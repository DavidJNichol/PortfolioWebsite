                Because we wanted make ammo a precious resource like in Resident Evil, we knew we needed to create
                a weapon system that lets the player swap back and forth from melee to gun. Each gun needed 
                bloom, recoil, reloading and aiming. The guns need to have IK and other animations and
                the player needs to be able to cancel them on the fly. Finally, we needed to have an accurate hitscan.

                    To start, we created an AWeapon class which implements the IInteractiveObject interface

                    needs to know when a swap input is fired is that it's swapping to a weapon. It doesn't need to know 
                    anything about recoil, damage or anything weapon type specific! Scroll wheel swapping can register
                    a lot of input events within a short amount of time, so having the function as light as possible is 
                    certainly optimal.

            When we swap weapons, we first need to check if we have more than one weapon or if we are 
            locked out of animation, which just checks if an animation is currently playing or if the weapon is aimed. 
            Then, we turn off the ability to shoot and make the current weapon invisible. After that we have the actual
            swap logic, and if we exceed the last position of our inventory we reach a pointer to the first slot. Then 
            we set the current weapon to be visible and update our hud sprite on the bottom right to match the current weapon.

            NotifyWeaponChange() locks us out of other animations by setting bIsSwapping to true, then broadcasts a custom FAnimationRequest
            delegate that plays our weapon equip animation based on the gun, and finally broadcasts a delegate that updates
            the IK system with required data based on the gun's position.

                    There are many objects in Project Nova that need to be interacted with by
                    the player. As a space engineer, there are always buttons that need pressing
                    or fuseboxes that need fixing. Thus, we needed a system where the player can scan the
                    environment around them and be aware of what they can and can't interact with.
                    But there is a problem. If you look at the image above, we have two different interactive objects,
                    one shotgun and one lever. If you were to look at one of those objects you might think to do this:

            <div class = "Description"> 
                However, the more interactive objects you have in the world the heavier and heavier the system gets.
                And what if you change your interact button to something else? What if AShotgun is a REALLY heavy class?
                Then everytime you look at the shotgun you need to know everything public about the shotgun. 
                That's really problematic!

                <div class = "DescriptionStart" style = "color: #FFFFCC">The Solution:</div>

                The IInteractiveObject interface solves the problem of having to check for each scanned object for
                each possible interactive item. All it needs to know is that it's an interactive object, and as long
                as each of those objects have some ground similarities, the scanning of objects logic could care less 
                about what it's looking at! As you can see above, IInteractiveObject is slim. The key components of 
                each interactive object are:
                <ul>
                    <li>A HUD prompt with a prefix, key, suffix and name. i.e. "Press Space to Vault"</li>
                    <li>A method that does something when the player looks at it</li>
                    <li>A method that does something when the player looks away</li>
                    <li>
                        A method that does something when the player presses the desired key to interact with the object,
                        and a delegate that fires with it as well
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A method that does something in blueprint when the player interacts
                    </li>
                    <li>A bool that determines whether or not we can interact with that object.</li>
                    <li>
                        A desired binding index (an index in Unreal's list of inputs in Project Settings->Engine->Input)
                        i.e. 0 is jump, 1 is shoot, 2 is interact
                    </li>
                </ul>

                That's all the shared logic we need! Let's see the base implementation of this interface in InteractiveObject.cpp::
            </div>

            <div class = "Description"> 
                IInteractiveObject::ReceiveLookedAt(APawn* EventSender) is a method that is called 
                once whenever an interactive object is looked at. In order for them to each have a custom
                key for interaction, we need to get a binding of that specific key, which is done in line 6.
                then we use the FInputActionHandler named Signature as a delegate to hook up the key press
                to the interactive object's InteractionEvent() function. We add this binding to EventSender which
                is the pawn who interacted with the object, and store a handle of that binding so we can remove it later.
            </div>

            <div class = "Description"> 
                Whenever the shooter looks away from the object, the binding is removed. This way, we don't have any clutter of
                extra bindings adding up and up causing the list of inputs to swell. This way also makes sure that you don't trigger
                the interaction event of a pistol when you pull a lever because you just looked at a pistol and 
                the interact buttons are both bound to the same key.
            </div>

            <div class = "Description"> 
                By default, our binding name is "Interact." This will return an input binding that is hooked
                up with the key "E" as shown below:

                AInteractableGeneratorPiece is an example of a very barebones interactive object. It has a BeginPlay()

                through blueprint, shown below:

            <div class = "Description"> 
                The obvious limitation to this approach is that we are binding to these input bindings based on strings.
                For example, FInputActionBinding("Interact", IE_Pressed) works, but if I misspell interact I'm going to 
                be very confused why it's not working. Or, if we change the name of the binding in the future we would need
                to change every string binding in our code.

                There are always decisions to be
                made about the level of abstraction for gameplay systems - abstract it too much and your code
                can run slow, and can become hard for others to follow. Abstract too little and you won't be 
                getting as much performance as you should be. Although it's not perfect, I think the interactive object 
                system I created is balanced in this way. Not too hard to read, not too slow. I learned a lot about 
                SOC by doing this.

                I learned a lot about SOC by doing this. There are pros and cons to both Unity and Unreal,
                but one thing that certainly is a plus in my book with Unreal C++ is the enforcement of OOP.
                In Unity, anything is a GameObject and anything can run any kind of script. It's much more 
                relaxed and thus easier to write messy code.

            <div class = "Description"> 
                Like any other game, we created a state system to manage things like animation and movement.
                A benefit to breaking down each condition that the character is in into states is that you 
                can specify exactly what limitations and what adaptations the player currently has.
                An example of what I mean is if the player has less than 50% health remaining, 
                then they enter the crippled state.

            <div class = "Description"> 
                Their walking animation may be different,
                they walk 30% slower, maybe they can no longer jump. The point is, separating those limitations 
                out into their own states enforces organization of those player conditions. More importantly, we can 
                enforce which states the player can and can't enter from that state, which means we don't have to
                have 100 bools and if statements spread throughout the player class determining what specific behavior
                is enabled or disabled.

            <div class = "Description"> 
                For this example, we are going to look at "venting" in our game, which is 
                still in the prototype phase. The process works like this:
                <ul>
                    <li>Player walks up to fusebox</li>
                    <li>Player interacts with fusebox, animation plays</li>
                    <li>Vent grates turn off and become interactable after anim is done</li>
                    <li>Player interacts with vent</li>
                    <li>Player lerps down to vent spline position and rotation</li>
                    <li>Player crawls to end of vent spline</li>
                    <li>Player lerps to standing position</li>
                </ul>

                while the player is in the vent phase, we have to make sure they can't just stand up
                and leave. The idea is that their movement is restricted to a 1D axis on that spline
                and they cannot turn around, because crawling in a vent should feel restrictive.
            </div>

            <img class="CodeImage" src="Images/Nova/Code/Example12.png" alt="">

            <div class = "Description"> 
                When the player interacts with the fusebox, the vent becomes interactable. When the player
                interacts with the vent the method above fires. If the player is the correct type of pawn we 
                are looking for, they enter the vent state, then we make sure the vent is no longer interactable,
                turning off the grate collision as that happens.
